##IMPORTANT NOTES
* Main method is located in the A3Driver.java file  
* try to run the progam in eclipse. the error messages will work best there  
* all the commands work even with extra arguments.  
  (allows the greatest flexibility for user input)
* some of the fields are case insensitive whenever possible  
  (ex. name is case sensitive, but command and category are case insensitive)

**Windows CMD Users:**  

_runprog.bat_ compiles and runs the program  
run the command: 	

runprog  \<transaction_file\>  
  
ex. runprog inputs
